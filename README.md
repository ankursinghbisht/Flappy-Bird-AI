# Flappy Bird AI


Discover the exciting Flappy Bird AI by engaging in the original game experience.
## Introduction

Immerse yourself in the timeless joy of the classic Flappy Bird game, enhanced with the presence of an intelligent AI that autonomously navigates the challenges.

Guiding the bird is a neural network, meticulously crafted through numerous rounds of the NEAT algorithm, ensuring a truly remarkable gameplay experience.
## Why Built it?
- Exploration of Game AI: My interest in the intersection of AI and gaming played a role in my decision. Developing a Flappy Bird AI allowed me to explore how AI agents can interact with and excel in simple video games. This project has laid the foundation for more complex and ambitious game AI ventures in the future.
- Challenge and Problem-Solving: The technical challenges presented by this project were a major driving force. Overcoming obstacles such as designing effective neural networks, implementing NEAT algorithms, and optimizing the AI's performance excited me and motivated me to push my skills to the limit.
- Showcasing My Abilities: One of my motivations was to showcase my technical prowess. Building an AI for a well-known game like Flappy Bird gives me a tangible project to feature in my portfolio and share on social media. It's a way for me to demonstrate my creativity and proficiency to potential employers or collaborators.
